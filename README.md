# Document layout with CRF

Use a CRF to label document layout. Inspired by Grobid, input and output data formats based on VILA (a LLM approach).

## PDFs

Born digital PDFs need to be converted to VILA format (a set of JSON files, one per page, that lists word and their bounding boxes).

### PDF to XML to JSON

Generate XML for PDF

`pdftoxml -blocks <pdf>`

Then run script `php pdfxml.php <basedir>` where <basedir> is the PDF file name minus the `.pdf` extension. This creates a base directory `<basedir>` with files `tokens<n>.json` that follow the VILA format (with added block information). Each JSON file describes a single page.

## Training

One way to train is to start with some already labelled data (e.g., from VILA or a previous run) and create a new output file: `php labels_to_crf.php > <basedir>.out`.

If you run `php colour.php <basedir>` on a <basedir> with `labels<n>.json` files you will generate HTML where tokens are colour-coded by label. This is a useful way to check that the labels are correct. You can manually edit the `.out` file to fix any bad labels. If you then run `php crf_to_labels.php <basedir> new `labels<n>.json` files will be generated. Rerun `php colour.php <basedir> to check that labels are now correct.

Combine any training data into `rod.train` and run `php train.php`.

### Template file

The template file `rod.template` tells the CRF code how to interpret the data. If this file doesnâ€™t exist it is generated when CRF data is created. If you change the model (e.g., by adding features) you will need to delete `rod.template` to ensure a new, correct template is created.

## Predict

To generate prediction for the files in `<basedir>` run `php predict.php <basedir>`. The resulting labels can be viewed with `php colour.php`.
